# Forex Correlations

*Published on May 27th, 2025*

Trading is not just about lines on a chart; it's about understanding the auction mechanics that drive price. In this article, we explore **Forex Correlations** and why it matters for both retail and institutional participants.

## The Core Concept

At its heart, Forex Correlations reveals the imbalance between buyers and sellers. When you master this, you stop guessing and start reacting to actual market data.

### Key Takeaway 1: Context is King
Never trade Forex Correlations in isolation. Always look at the higher timeframe market structure. Are we in a trend or a range?

### Key Takeaway 2: Risk Management
Even the best setup using Forex Correlations can fail. Always define your risk (R-multiple) before entering the trade.

## Conclusion

Mastering Forex Correlations takes time, but it is a fundamental building block of a profitable system. Practice identifying it on historical charts before risking live capital.
