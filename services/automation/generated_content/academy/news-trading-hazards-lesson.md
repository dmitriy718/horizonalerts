## The Institutional Perspective

### Institutional Traders
Institutions such as banks and hedge funds typically have several advantages over retail traders during news events. They possess faster information systems, advanced algorithms (algos), and teams of economists and analysts who can interpret news quickly and accurately. Institutions often act on news before it even becomes publicly available through forecasts and private channels, positioning them ahead of the curve.

### Retail Traders
Conversely, retail traders are generally on the back foot. They receive news with a slight delay and lack the sophisticated tools to analyze the impact thoroughly. Retail trading during news relies more on speculation and immediate price action, making it a risky affair.

**Key Difference:** Institutions might view news as a confirmation or adjustment to their pre-existing strategies, whereas retail traders see it as a primary opportunity for entry.

## Core Mechanics

**The Theory:**
When news hits the markets, it triggers a flood of reactions from all market participants, altering supply and demand dynamics instantaneously. This can lead to sharp price movements and increased volatility.

**Analogy:**
Imagine pouring a sudden rush of water into a funnel; the initial reaction is chaotic turbulence before eventually smoothing out. Similarly, news events cause initial chaos in pricing, which might stabilize later.

### Essential Concepts:
1. **Liquidity Disruptions:** News can cause sudden liquidity holes where prices may jump significantly, bypassing levels where orders might have been placed.
2. **Volatility Spikes:** Increased uncertainty can cause wider spreads and slippage, impacting the entry and exit points unfavorably.

## Strategy & Execution

### Step-by-Step Setup:
1. **Preparation:**
   - **Research**: Understand the historical impact of the news.
   - **Timing**: News release schedules are crucial. Be ready minutes before.
   - **Technology**: Use platforms that offer fast execution.

2. **Entry Points:**
   - **Anticipation**: Some traders enter before the news to capture the initial reaction. High risk, potentially high reward.
   - **Confirmation**: Wait for some initial dust to settle and enter on confirmation signals. Safer, but potentially lower reward.

3. **Stop Loss and Take Profit:**
   - **Stop Loss**: Set wider than usual to accommodate increased volatility. Factor in possible slippage.
   - **Take Profit**: Set realistic targets based on the typical reaction the news has had in the past, adjusting for current market context.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overleveraging:** In pursuit of higher profits, traders often take on excessive risk.
2. **Emotional Trading:** News can provoke impulsive decisions. Stick to your trading plan.
3. **Poor Timing:** Misjudging the entry or exit during high volatility can lead to significant losses.
