## Executive Summary

### The "Why" and "What" of RSI Divergence

RSI Divergence is a sophisticated trading strategy used in the financial markets to predict potential reversals in price trends. This approach capitalizes on the divergence between the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, and the price action itself. The rationale behind this strategy is grounded in identifying discrepancies where the price of an asset makes a new high or low that is not corroborated by the RSI. Such discrepancies can suggest weakening momentum and potential shifts in market direction.

This lesson aims to equip intermediate traders with the knowledge to execute RSI Divergence strategies effectively while offering insight into how these strategies are viewed and applied differently by institutional versus retail traders.

## The Institutional Perspective

### Banks/Algorithms vs. Retail Traders

**Institutional Traders:**
Institutions often use RSI divergence as part of a broader algorithmic strategy that incorporates multiple indicators and extensive back-testing. They view divergences not as stand-alone signals but as components of a larger, statistically validated approach. Algorithmic trading ensures that such strategies are executed with high precision and minimal emotional interference, capitalizing on divergence signals quickly and efficiently.

**Retail Traders:**
Most retail traders perceive RSI Divergence as a direct signal for entry or exit, often without the robust risk management and diversification that institutions employ. While retail traders can maneuver more flexibly than large institutions, they often risk misinterpreting signals or over-relying on them without adequate confirmation from other market factors or indicators.

## Core Mechanics

### Theory and Analogies

Imagine driving a car where the speedometer starts to slow down, but you're still accelerating. This discrepancy between the car's displayed speed and actual acceleration could suggest an issue with the car's engine performance. Similarly, when price highs or lows are not supported by corresponding highs or lows on the RSI, it suggests a "weakening" of the market's "engine."

**Key Concepts:**
- **RSI Calculation**: RSI values range from 0 to 100, indicating overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) levels.
- **Divergence**: A bullish divergence occurs when the price records a lower low, but RSI forms a higher low, suggesting an upcoming upward reversal. Conversely, a bearish divergence happens when the price hits a higher high, but RSI forms a lower high, indicating possible downward reversal.

## Strategy & Execution

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Identify the Market Condition**: Look for trending markets where RSI divergence could indicate a potential reversal.
2. **Spot the Divergence**: Compare the peaks and troughs on the price chart with those on the RSI indicator.
3. **Entry Points**:
   - **Bullish Divergence**: Enter a buy position when RSI starts to turn up from an oversold level after forming a divergence with the price.
   - **Bearish Divergence**: Enter a sell position when RSI begins to turn down from an overbought level after a divergence.
4. **Stop Loss and Take Profit**:
   - Set a stop loss just below the recent low for bullish setups, or above the recent high for bearish setups.
   - Take profit should align with key resistance (for buys) or support levels (for sells).

## Common Pitfalls

### Where Most Traders Lose Money

1. **Over-trading on Divergence Alone**: Relying solely on RSI divergence without confirmation from other indicators or market factors.
2. **Ignoring Volatility**: Not considering market volatility can lead to misplaced stop losses, resulting in premature exit from positions.
3. **Emotional Trading**: Deviating from the trading plan under emotional pressure, either to cut losses or realize gains prematurely.

## Quiz

1. **What is RSI Divergence?**
   - Answer: A market situation where the price action creates new highs or lows that are not confirmed by the RSI, suggesting potential for a price direction reversal.

2. **Describe a scenario for a bullish RSI divergence setup.**
   - Answer: A stock reaches a new low price, but the RSI forms a higher low during the same period. Traders might consider a buy entry assuming weak downward price momentum.

3. **Explain why it's crucial to use additional indicators alongside RSI divergence.**
   - Answer: RSI divergence alone can sometimes lead to false signals. Using additional indicators helps validate the divergence and improves the robustness of the trading strategy.

By understanding and applying RSI Divergence strategies effectively, intermediate traders can enhance their trading toolkit, allowing for more informed and potentially lucrative trading decisions.
